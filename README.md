Creating a website with a fucntional rock paper scissor game. To make it more interesting, it has become a
Spray botttle - Box - cucumber game to accomodate all the feline pc user. Those typically sitting on laptops.
These weapons will make the game feel more exciting since these are real life weapons and defences used by our 
feline comrades.

This is the first git commit and the game only contains html and JS at this point. The game is functional. 
Each win, loss or draw delivers its own personal message to our protagonist "Killer kitten".
And a loss message to our antagonist, "Radi-claws.


still to come:
> add best out of 5, with win and loss message
> add a pretty and user interface with css an js.
> add mathmatical problems - if you can solve the problem you are more likley to know the next choice of "Radi-claws"
